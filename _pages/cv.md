#### Profile
Currently I am a state registered Consultant Clinical Scientist and Pathology Clinical Director at University Hospitals Birmingham.
## Experience
I am pathology director for University Hospitals Birmingham and oversee a large multidisciplinary pathology service (2019 – present), providing clinical leadership and direction.

### Pathology Director, 2019 - Present, University Hospitals Birmingham

### CONSULTANT CLINICAL SCIENTIST, UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS BIRMINGHAM — 2004-PRESENT
During this time, I have been acting as an independent practitioner in the largest laboratory in the West Midlands. My clinical specialty is clinical biochemistry.
### FEBRUARY 2019 - APRIL 2020, I WAS CLINICAL SERVICE LEAD FOR BIOCHEMISTRY/IMMUNOLOGY/TOXICOLOGY AND POINT OF CARE TESTING AT UHB
After reorganisation of pathology I was responsible for service delivery over 4 hospital sites with over 120 whole time equivalents of varying grades of staff (Medics, Clinical Scientists, Biomedical Scientists, Medical Laboratory Assistants, and ancillary staff). I was responsible for clinical leadership and ensuring the quality of the clinical biochemistry services to international standards (ISO 15189)
### JANUARY 2013 AND FEBRUARY 2019 CLINICAL LEAD FOR BLOOD SCIENCES AT BIRMINGHAM HEARTLANDS HOSPITAL.
I was clinical lead for blood sciences (automated biochemistry and hematology) and an integral member of the team that built a new laboratory facility at Heartlands Hospital. After leading the specialist testing workgroup, I was transferred and made responsible for the implementation of an automated track system for the provision of routine biochemistry which processes over 4500 tubes of blood per day, produc-ing around 4.5 million tests per year.
### BETWEEN MAY 2011 AND JAN 2013 HEAD OF DEPARTMENT FOR BIOCHEMISTRY AND IMMUNOLOGY.
I provided clinical leadership for the department of Biochemistry and Immunology and continued my responsibility for specialist chemistry, research, and develop-ment. 
### BETWEEN MAY 2004 AND JAN 2011 CONSULTANT CLINICAL SCIENTIST DEPARTMENT FOR BIOCHEMISTRY AND IMMUNOLOGY.
I was responsible for all aspects of service development (procurement, funding, re-search, and development) and have developed and published methods supporting a wide variety of clinical services. I have developed and directed the development of highly automated methods for the analysis of Vitamin D (analyzing 80,000 sam-ples per year at low unit cost) and other compounds (Testosterone, Steroids, Bio-genic Amines, Metabolites in the Methionine Cycle, Prostaglandins) including pro-teins/peptides (corticotrophic releasing hormone and Hepcidin). I led on several business cases, including purchasing mass spectrometers, and creating toxicology at Heartlands Hospital.

I was training lead for clinical scientists; a member of the regional training scheme and the trust lead clinical scientist.

### PRINCIPAL CLINICAL SCIENTIST, DEPT OF CLINICAL PATHOLOGY, NOTTINGHAM CITY HOSPITAL, NOTTINGHAM — 2001 - 2004
In this role I was responsible for the electrophoresis and Downs Syndrome screening services in addition to general clinical biochemistry. These services supported the clinical service provision at a multi-specialty hospital. While here I developed and implemented capillary electrophoresis methods to help support the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma.
### SENIOR CLINICAL SCIENTIST, DEPT OF CLINICAL PATHOLOGY, NOTTINGHAM CITY HOSPITAL, NOTTINGHAM — 1999 - 2001
In this role I was responsible for the development and implementation of point of care testing in addition to the provision of clinical support for general clinical biochemistry
### SENIOR CLINICAL SCIENTIST, DEPARTMENT OF BIOCHEMISTRY, BROOMFIELD HOSPITAL, CHELMSFORD — 1995 - 2001
In this role I was responsible for the provision of clinical support for general clinical biochemistry and the implementation of a quality management system.
### GRADE A CLINICAL SCIENTIST, DEPARTMENT OF BIOCHEMISTRY, LEEDS GENERAL INFIRMARY, LEEDS — 1992 - 1995
This role was a training role, for my master thesis I developed a method to determine glycosylation patterns of proteins in the acute phase response.
## Skills
Underpinning my role has been a strong background in informatics and information technology. I am a competent computer programmer (C#, JavaScript, and Ruby) and have developed my own commercial applications both on iOS and World Wide Web. I apply these skills to break complex problems and tasks into smaller functional units which make me an excellent problem solver. I am skilled in Information Technology and Management and I have integrated mass spectrometry systems into the routine clinical laboratory as well as producing applications and software for various scenarios.

During my career I have undertaken and participated in several core IT projects – from GP connect in the 1990’s (connecting GP surgeries for electronic reporting – regional lead for Essex) to securing a grant with Dr Rick Jones to develop the message standards that currently underpin NPex (The National Pathology Exchange) and lab to lab communication.

More recently I have been involved and researched effective mechanisms for the use of laboratory services – “smart” electronic requesting and visualisation of laboratory results.

I have a strong analytical background and have expertise in several analytical techniques, principally Tandem Mass Spectroscopy and Capillary Electrophoresis. I believe I have been innovative in developing and implementing services and products, often with constrained resources. I have used my IT skills for example writing automated interfaces between laboratory information systems and mass spectrometers or working with suppliers to develop commercial alternatives. These skills are generalisable and transferable, particularly around problem solving and system flow.

I am a good communicator and I teach regularly on clinical data interpretation and mass spectrometry for Greenwich University and the University of Birmingham. I have been invited to speak at national and international conferences.

I can act on initiative; identify opportunities and I am proactive in putting forward ideas and solutions within my team and on a wider strategic scale. I am motivated to provide the highest quality, cost efficient assays and clinical services.

I am a good team leader and excel in leadership roles enabling me to deliver high quality projects on time and within budget.

I have good project management skills and I have supervised students for the research component of their MSc as well as directing projects to deliver clinical services.

I have been responsible for implementing demand management systems, ranging from systems where requests are rejected based on various clinical parameters e.g., minimum testing intervals for CRP, TSH and Haematinics, to systems based on shaping requests at the source by recommending tests based on clinical information e.g., Profile based requesting in the Emergency Department at Heartlands which reduced test requests by approx. 30%. This work also won an innovation award from a regional clinical leadership group.
Clinically my specialty is pheochromocytoma and vitamin D metabolism.
